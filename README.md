# Coventic Webpage
This webpage was designed to practice css animations and transitions.
The step-by-step tutorials was obtained from Easy Tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZTCciHE72I&t=191s), including the resources.
The Web page is not optimised for mibile responsiveness though, it was just made to showcase animations, without considering responsiveness. 

## Thank you.
